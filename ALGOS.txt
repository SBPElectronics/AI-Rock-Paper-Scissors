The Look-Back Algorithm:
1. Algorithm 1 looks at all the moves you've made in the game so far.
It counts how many times you used Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Whichever one you used the most, it assumes you'll play that again.
Then the bot plays the move that beats it.

Example:
If you played Rock 6 times, Paper 3 times, and Scissors 1 time,
the bot thinks you'll probably play Rock again,
so it plays Paper to beat your Rock.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. It checks how many times you played Rock, Paper, or Scissors in just those 5 recent moves.

Then, it guesses you’ll play the one you used the most recently.

Finally, the bot plays the move that beats that.

Example:
Let’s say your last 5 moves were:
Rock, Rock, Paper, Rock, Scissors

The counts would be:
Rock = 3, Paper = 1, Scissors = 1

So the bot thinks you'll play Rock again,
and plays Paper to beat it.

It’s like the bot is paying close attention to your recent behavior instead of your full history.
